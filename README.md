# Weather-App
A project for The Odin Project's Javascript Course, where we have to build a Weather Application.  
Below are the assignments of the project:  
1. Set up a blank HTML document with the appropriate links to the JavaScript and CSS files.  
2. Write the functions that hit the API. A functions that can take a location and return the weather data for that location. For now, just console.log() the information.  
3. Write the functions that process the JSON data from the API and return an object with only the data required for the app.  
4. Set up a simple form that will let users input their location and will fetch the weather info (still just console.log() it).
5. Display the information on the webpage!
6. Add any styling for the webpage.
7. Optional: add a ‘loading’ component that displays from the time the form is submitted until the information comes back from the API.
8. Push it to github and share the solution in project page!
